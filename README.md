#NeuroSynth

Synthesiser and sequencer based somewhat on the concept of neural networks. This is a WebAudio / WebGL port of an old [Flash experiment I wrote in 2010](http://blog.soulwire.co.uk/laboratory/flash/as3-tonfall-particle-node-sequencer) that in turn inspired the app [Nodebeat](http://nodebeat.com/).
